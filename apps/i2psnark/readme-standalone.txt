To run i2psnark's standalone mode make sure you have an i2p router running in the background, then run:

java -jar i2psnark-standalone.jar

then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:1888/i2psnark/ 

I2PSnark is GPL'ed software, based on Snark (http://www.klomp.org/) to run on top of I2P
(http://www.i2p2.de/) within a webserver (such as the bundled Jetty from
http://jetty.mortbay.org/).  For more information about I2PSnark, get in touch
with the folks at http://forum.i2p2.de/
